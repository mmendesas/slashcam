# Slash Camera

- Simple Chat app using nodejs and WebRTC.

<div align="center" style="display: flex; flex-direction:column">
  <div>Just play around with WebRTC</div>
  <img alt="preview" src="src/assets/app-preview.png" width="70%" />
</div>

## What I've learned

- I learned about socket communication
- Learn how to play with WebRTC too ([they have awesome docs](https://webrtc.github.io/samples/))

## How to test this implementation

In the project directory, you can run:

- `yarn`: Intalling dependencies
- `yarn dev` : Start in development mode
- `browser tabs`: open the browser tabs to see all the things in action

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

> Warning: This is only an example app, with a lot of references, just to play around WebRTC and understand the video meet process
